# game-controller

# for the back 

create the virtualenv
```bat
python -m virtualenv workenv
./workenv/Scripts/activate
```

```bat
cd api/controller
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# for the UI

have nodejs and npm installed

```bat
cd ui/interface
npm install

```

now you can execute everything with runner.bat (a simple script that group the run process)
